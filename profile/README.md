We are DeepDrive, an E-mobility startup from Munich. Our founding team has already met almost a decade ago at TUfast, the student motorsport team of TU Munich. Since our incorporation in May 2021, we have developed a revolutionary powertrain technology for electric vehicles, received huge interest from the world's biggest automakers, and are now working with many of them on creating more sustainable, efficient, and cheaper electric vehicles in all sizes and shapes. Our team of 25 combines deep domain expertise and experience in large-scale Automotive series projects with a passion for revolutionary innovation.

In February 2022, we raised a seed funding of 4.3 million euros with UVC Partners, Bayern Kapital, and business angels Jonas Rieke (COO of Personio) and Dr. Peter Mertens (former CTO of Audi and Volvo).
